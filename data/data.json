been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center &mdash; an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman&#39;s earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there&#39;s no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That&#39;s how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Final Frontier</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There can be no thought of finishing for &lsquo;aiming for the stars.&rsquo; Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations.

And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Reaching for the Stars</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally, it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart.

Have some broad assumptions about your target audience, and then narrow down. </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When you&#39;re first creating a digital presence, you&#39;ll want to start by focusing on some broad, easy-to-identify categories of your target market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your team can begin by identifying <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/demographic-segmentation?_ga=2.38199460.64004374.1566500811-1493293515.1553017609\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">demographic segmentation</a>&nbsp;for your customer persona.

Analyze competitors&#39; target audiences to see if your product or service will appeal to similar audiences.</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When finding your audience online, it&#39;s important not to get overwhelmed by spreading your net too wide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More than likely, your product or service exists in some capacity in the market already. So take a look at what your competitors are doing to get inspiration for your own digital strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, if you see most of your competitors creating ads for YouTube, it could be a sign that YouTube has proven to be an effective strategy in your industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>3</strong><strong>.

Explore the social channels that are most popular with your target audience. </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>HubSpot&#39;s Blog Research found 57% of consumers discover products most often on social media &nbsp;&mdash; and 23% of 18-24 year olds <em>prefer</em>&nbsp;to purchase products directly through social media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which means social media is an undeniably powerful opportunity to increase sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plus, social media has a huge audience &mdash; over <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/278414/number-of-worldwide-social-network-users/#:~:text=Social%20media%20usage%20is%20one,almost%204.41%20billion%20in%202025.\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">3.6 billion people use it worldwide</a>. So, regardless of your marketing goals, it&#39;s imperative you create a digital presence on at least one of the social platforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&#39;re new to the social media world, you&#39;ll want to start by identifying which channels you want to go after first. To do this, you&#39;ll need to determine where your target audience spends their time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The three top social media channels in terms of monthly active users are Facebook (2.9 billion MAU), YouTube (2.2 billion MAU), and Instagram (2 billion MAU). It&#39;s a good idea to start with a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/hubspot-blog-social-media-marketing-report?_ga=2.38199460.64004374.1566500811-1493293515.1553017609\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">channel with a large potential reach</a>, and then narrow down from there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Social media can also help you listen to your prospects and customers and learn from them to grow better. As <a href=\"https://impulsecreative.com/?_ga=2.38199460.64004374.1566500811-1493293515.1553017609\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Impulse Creative&#39;s</a> Senior Growth Marketer, Molly Rigatti, puts it, &quot;We&#39;ve found that creating a space where people can ask their questions is much more effective than trying to start conversations by telling businesses what they need to succeed.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rigatti says, &quot;We listen. We listen to our customers&#39; wants and needs. We listen to diagnose their real problems rather than to prescribe the easiest sale.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&#39;re still unsure how to build your social media presence, take a look at <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/4663/how-to-monitor-your-social-media-presence-in-10-minutes-a-day.aspx?_ga=2.38199460.64004374.1566500811-1493293515.1553017609\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">21 Ways To Build Your Social Media Presence, Like HubSpot Marketers</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>5. Leverage Google Ads to increase your reach.</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>While paid advertising can feel daunting with a limited budget, you can leverage powerful targeting capabilities for a relatively low cost with Google Ads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To uncover some tips for getting the most out of Google Ads with limited resources, I spoke to HubSpot&#39;s Director of Advertising, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rex-gelb-43445b1b/?_ga=2.38199460.64004374.1566500811-1493293515.1553017609\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Rex Gelb</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When it comes to an effective keyword strategy for startups and small businesses, Gelb told me, &quot;My recommendation would be to start with the&nbsp;keywords that best relate to your core products or services,&nbsp;and branch out from there.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, let&#39;s say you sell a niche product within a larger category &mdash; such as soccer cleats for kids.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;To start,&quot; Gelb says, &quot;I&#39;d bid on exactly that: &#39;Soccer cleats for kids&#39;. If that&#39;s going well and you have the budget, then maybe you try bidding on &#39;Soccer cleats&#39; next, and if <em>that</em>&nbsp;works, &#39;cleats&#39; after that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gelb adds, &quot;Broadening your targeting like this means you&#39;ll get some irrelevant clicks and have some wasted ad spend, but you&#39;ll also get more scale and it&#39;s possible you&#39;ll find that even with the higher customer acquisition cost, you&#39;re still generating a positive ROI.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Google Ads is an undeniably powerful tool for reaching new customers. In fact, for users who are ready to buy, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-adwords-ppc?_ga=2.38199460.64004374.1566500811-1493293515.1553017609\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">paid ads on Google get 65% of the clicks</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, like any effective long-term marketing strategy, Google Ads takes work. As Gelb puts it, &quot;A lot of businesses are looking for &#39;tips and tricks&#39; to try and beat the system, but I&#39;d say 70-80% of Google Ads is using tried-and-true best practices.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So &hellip; what are these best practices? Gelb advises, &quot;Pick keywords that make sense for your business, write ads that are highly relevant to those keywords, pick the correct campaign objective based on your business goals, monitor the search term report, and test, test, test. If you do those things (and read up a bit on match types if you&#39;re not familiar with them), you&#39;re going to be most of the way there.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"rex gelb on small business google ad strategies\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/rex%20gelb%20on%20small%20business%20google%20ad%20strategies.png?width=1600&amp;name=rex%20gelb%20on%20small%20business%20google%20ad%20strategies.png\" style=\"width:800px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately, creating a digital presence takes time, but it&#39;s worth it.

How does this role contribute to larger company goals?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s not terribly difficult to find a candidate who can execute in a role. It <em>is, </em>however, terribly difficult to find a candidate who can also understand how it fits into larger goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This includes being able to self-manage, prioritize high-value activities, and grow their role in a direction that aligns with the company&#39;s growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>How It Helps You</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>This information can be hard to come by if your company isn&#39;t very communicative or transparent, so this is a good chance to get that information to use it to guide your decisions if you land the role.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. What do the most successful new hires do in their first month here?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This question shows that you&#39;re the type of person who likes to hit the ground running.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It also shows that you recognize patterns of success and want to replicate only the most effective performers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>How It Helps You</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Every company has its weird nuances, its own environment, and its own unspoken expectations. This helps you start with a little bit of the insider info so you don&#39;t suffer a case of &quot;if I knew then what I knew now&quot; in six months.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. What metrics would you use to measure success in this role?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Asking a question like this shows that you&#39;re goal-oriented and aren&#39;t afraid to be held accountable for those goals. You don&#39;t avoid accountability, you welcome it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>How It Helps You</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s shocking how many people don&#39;t actually know what they want from their employees beyond a vague idea of some work that needs to get done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asking this question will force a hiring manager to figure it out &ndash; and then can communicate it to you, so you can execute on it.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div style=\"margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto\">\r\n<div style=\"margin-left:0; margin-right:0\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h3>4. What are some of the challenges or roadblocks I might come up against in this role?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A question like this indicates that you&#39;re already envisioning yourself in the role and thinking through a plan of attack, should you land the gig.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s also a sign that you&#39;re well aware that no job comes free of roadblocks. It signals that not only are you not afraid to deal with those challenges, but you&#39;re also prepared for them.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>How It Helps You</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The response you receive should help you better understand some of the less-than-ideal aspects of the job &ndash; bureaucratic processes, internal politics, and so on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can use that information to decide if you&#39;re up for the challenge.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>5. What is the biggest challenge the team has faced in the past year?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>While the interviewer might be trying to paint a pretty perfect picture of what working on the team might look like, asking this question will help you uncover some of the realities the team has been facing recently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you end up joining, you&#39;ll inevitably hear about these challenges &ndash; and you may have to help solve them, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>How It Helps You</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>It really helps to know what challenges you could find yourself or your team up against ahead of time. In some cases, it could affect whether you accept the role.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Learning about these challenges could give you some great insights into the steps the team has taken to overcome these challenges already.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>6. Why did you decide to work at this company?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This question gives an interviewer a chance to do two self-serving things: talk about themselves and perform a no-holds-barred sales pitch on the company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For promising candidates, the sales opportunity is welcomed. And most people love any excuse to talk about themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>How It Helps You</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>This gives you insight into what motivates your future colleague or manager, as well as what the company offers its employees. If those all line up with what you&#39;re looking for in a job, you&#39;ve got yourself a good fit.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>7. What keeps you motivated?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If your interviewer has been at the company for a while, understanding why could give you some really interesting insight into the company and its relationship with its employees.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>How It Helps You</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Depending on the interviewer&#39;s answer, you might learn something about the company&#39;s career training, leadership opportunities, workplace flexibility, internal job opportunities, and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You might dig a little deeper by following up with related questions, like, &quot;What do you enjoy most about working here?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>8. Do you host any events with the team outside of work?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Does everyone keep their head down and do their own thing? Or does everyone enjoy each other&#39;s company? <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/common-interview-questions?_ga=2.38199460.64004374.1566500811-1493293515.1553017609\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">This interview question</a> serves as a great way to find out a little bit about the company culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ideally, there&#39;s a good balance of work and life and the company creates opportunities for those to blend.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>How It Helps You</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Along with learning about company culture, this is a more lighthearted question that might relax a stiffened atmosphere or lead to a conversation about shared interests.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>9. What is your company&#39;s customer or client service philosophy?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This is an impressive question because it shows that you can make the connection between how the company thinks about its customers and the end result.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, how the customer is treated on a day-to-day basis, and in turn, how that shows up in the product.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>How It Helps You</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>While you might be able to find a canned response to this question on the company&#39;s website, it&#39;ll be useful &ndash; and possibly eye-opening &ndash; for you to hear it more candidly from an employee.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>10. What are some of the less tangible traits of successful people on this team?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Ever work with people who just <em>get it?</em> That&#39;s who hiring managers are looking for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This question demonstrates that you understand a job is about more than just going through the motions. Successful people have a specific frame of mind, approach, attitude, work ethic, communication style, and so on &ndash; and you want to know what that mix looks like at this company.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>How It Helps You</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Because these characteristics are often hard to pin down, this question forces a hiring manager to articulate that &quot;it&quot; factor they&#39;re really looking for &ndash; even if it wasn&#39;t written in the job description.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>11. What behaviors do the most successful members of the team exhibit?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Asking a question like this shows you&#39;re interested in getting a practical example of what success looks like to the manager of the team you&#39;d be joining.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plus, when you phrase the question in this way, &quot;you leave no room for a hypothetical answer,&quot; says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/davefernandez?_ga=2.38199460.64004374.1566500811-1493293515.1553017609\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Dave Fernandez</a>, a former recruiting team lead at HubSpot. Instead, you&#39;re pushing the hiring manager to think about their top performer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>How It Helps You</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Because this question forces an example, the answer to this question will give you a strong idea of what success actually looks like. That way, you&#39;ll learn what it takes to impress your colleagues and be a star candidate.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>12. What behaviors do the people who struggle most on the team exhibit?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Follow up <a href=\"#question-9\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">question #9 </a>with this question, and you&#39;ll show the hiring manager that you&#39;re really trying to get a concrete idea of what to do and what not to do as an employee on the specific team you&#39;re applying to join, says Fernandez.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While this question can make a manager uncomfortable, it&#39;s impressive because it shows that you&#39;re not afraid to ask tough questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>How It Helps You</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>First, you&#39;ll get an idea of what poor performance looks like, which will help you set expectations for the position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, you&#39;ll learn how the hiring manager handles a tough question like this &ndash; which can teach you something about how office politics are handled in general.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>13. How do you deliver negative feedback?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you would be working with the person interviewing you, this is another tough question that can give you some insight into how the team works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It pushes the hiring manager to think about how they would handle an uneasy situation, while at the same time highlighting your self-awareness.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>How It Helps You</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Everything gives and receives feedback differently. Does this person tailor their feedback approach depending on whom they&#39;re giving it to? Do they make feedback a two-way street?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Their feedback style &ndash; especially when it comes to negative feedback &ndash; will help you understand how well you would be able to work with them.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>14. Do you have any questions or concerns about my qualifications?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This question shows that you&#39;re not afraid of critical feedback &ndash; in fact, you welcome it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interviewers tend to make note of red flags to discuss with a colleague following the interview, whether it be something on your resume or something you said</p>\r\n\r\n<p>. This question gives them the green light to ask about any of the things that are holding them back from being 100% on board with hiring you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>How It Helps You</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>You get a chance to address concerns face-to-face without being too confrontational.

What do you like most about working here?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This question can be a breath of fresh air to HR reps who primarily answer questions about benefits (which are valuable questions).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asking an HR employee what they like about the company tells them you care about the company&#39;s culture and that you care about the opinion of someone whom you might not work with directly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, talking to people like people is always a good idea.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. How has this position changed over time?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s easy to forget that someone might have once held the position you&#39;re applying for &ndash; or, more importantly, that the role might have evolved since it came on your radar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&#39;t be afraid to ask HR what this job looked like before you were interested in it. This can include what the responsibilities looked like, how many other people currently hold this position at the company, and even where HR thinks it&#39;s going in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Getting HR&#39;s perspective on the history of your potential role can give you unbiased insight into your department, <em>and</em> let HR know that you&#39;re interested in your future at the company &ndash; not just your present.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. What does this team&#39;s role hierarchy look like? How does this position fit into it?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This is another big-picture question that HR should be equipped and eager to answer for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You might not want to bluntly ask &quot;who would I report to?&quot; It can show resistance or insecurity before you ever set foot in the role. But, it&#39;s still something you might want to know.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4. How does the company promote diversity and inclusion?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Every company should always be working toward building a diverse and inclusive work environment. If they don&#39;t, that&#39;s something you should know ahead of time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asking this question will tell you which initiatives or programs the company is involved in and what active measures they&#39;re taking toward this mission.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>5. What are you most excited about in this company&#39;s future?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Want to inject a little positivity into your phone call with HR? Ask them what has them pumped up right now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What motivates them to get up in the morning? Put yourself in HR&#39;s shoes: Wouldn&#39;t you love to answer this question, especially if you love the company you work for?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asking the HR rep what they&#39;re most excited about shows them that you, too, thrive on enthusiasm. It also brings the best out in your interviewer &ndash; a good headspace for HR to be in as they hand you off to the hiring manager.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>6. What is something the company is still working on getting right?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As a flip-side to the question above, also consider asking HR what they think the company&#39;s greatest challenge is right now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While other candidates might be skittish around a business&#39;s weaknesses, <em>this</em> question shows HR you&#39;re willing to accept the current negatives and join them in righting the ship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note the phrasing of this question, too. By asking HR this question precisely this way, you put focus on the positive and show the company that you have natural optimism (a desired trait in <a href=\"https://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/8-reasons-why-optimists-are-better-leaders.html?_ga=2.38199460.64004374.1566500811-1493293515.1553017609\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">future leaders</a>, just so you know).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>7. Is there a dress code I should abide by?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Dress code can be a touchy subject in interviews &ndash; you don&#39;t want to reveal that you have deal-breakers so early into a hiring process. But, it is an important aspect of the job for many professionals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to get an idea of the company&#39;s dress code without suggesting it&#39;s a big deal to you, simply ask HR what you&#39;re expected to wear on your first day. It&#39;s a harmless question that gives you the information you need at the same time.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>8. Is there anything about my application that makes you doubt my qualifications right now?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Cap off your phone screening with this confidence play. Asking HR what they&#39;re skeptical about with respect to your application can show them you welcome feedback and you can take criticism. It also helps you better prepare for your next interview.&nbsp;<!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>" } }, { "model": "blog.post", "pk": 4, "fields": { "title": "Organizing Real Estate Teams to Scale", "title_short": "Organizing real estate", "cover": "media/featured_images/2022/06/28/ab1acf7b94e55bbe9e0ba16ba2f2ee2c_hlqlyi", "slug": "organizing-real-estate-teams-to-scale", "author": 2, "updated_on": "2022-06-29T01:36:51.597Z", "content": "test", "created_on": "2022-06-26T21:10:44.335Z", "status": 1, "body": "<div style=\"margin-left:0; margin-right:0\">\r\n<h1 style=\"margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto\">Organizing Real Estate Teams to Scale Another update</h1>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h2>Want a Successful Real Estate Team?

Act on Behalf:</strong>&nbsp; Admins &amp; Transaction Coordinators Can Take Action on Behalf of Team Members</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Many admins and <a href=\"https://www.dotloop.com/blog/2020/06/transaction-coordinator-checklists/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">transaction coordinators</a> are surprised to find that dotloop for Teams allows them to not only view the overall progress of a loop (transaction) but also allows them to take the controls when the agent is otherwise detained. Real estate teams, in particular, love this extra level of flexibility to stay on top of tasks and move the transaction forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://support.dotloop.com/hc/en-us/articles/215510857-Teams-On-Behalf-Of?__hstc=51647990.e6c11043606e4d8ec16229732b9a0386.1641223033656.1653575232555.1653583939960.201&amp;__hssc=51647990.18.1653583939960&amp;__hsfp=47396950\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Act on Behalf</a> feature empowers admins and transaction coordinators to take action on behalf of their agents and complete any steps in the transaction as if the agent had completed the action. With Act on Behalf, admins and transaction coordinators can create loops for agents (which will live in the agent&rsquo;s profile), and then edit, add, assign and share documents either as themselves or as if the action is coming from the agent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Admins and transaction coordinators can review the documents for compliance and submit the file to the brokerage for approval, assuming the brokerage is using <a href=\"https://www.dotloop.com/brokers/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">dotloop Business+</a> at the office level. By acting on behalf of the agent, the admin or transaction coordinator stays in the loop on documents pending approval and closing status.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While any action can be completed on behalf of the agent, any signature or initial fields signed by the admin or transaction coordinator will reflect coming from the admin or transaction coordinator, not the agent. Also, the activity log will show all actions completed as the admin or transaction coordinator on behalf of the agent, avoiding any confusion over who did what.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p><img alt=\"quote from real estate pro\" class=\"lazyloaded\" src=\"https://35blqf1aden92dok8un11nz1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/quote-gray-48.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our transaction has been one of the smoothest pieces through all of the pandemic. I had three admins logging in and logging out [of individual dotloop agent accounts] on average 30 minutes per day. I was paying admins $15/hour &hellip; multiply that times three and we found that it was costing us $45 per day [not being on the teams-specific platform]. So when <a href=\"https://www.dotloop.com/teams/\" rel=\"noopener\" style=\"font-size: 100%;\" target=\"_blank\">dotloop for Teams</a> rolled around, we jumped on it. Now, I get a notification every time one of my agents writes a contract. Additionally, admins get notified every time something happens. So if an agent needs something, the admin gets a notification and can jump on it to help out. That part of the business is 100% on point.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div><img alt=\"J.

Transaction Templates:</strong>&nbsp;Save Agents Time by Automatically Including All Necessary Documents in Transactions</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Arguably, no other digital transaction tool will help agents, admins and transaction coordinators save time and stay organized like dotloop&rsquo;s Transaction Templates, a digital folder that provides quick access to a set of custom, pre-populated documents. With Transaction Templates (aka Loop Templates), real estate teams have instant access to all the documents, people and tasks associated with a specific transaction, such as a residential listing or a residential buyer packet. This eliminates the searching for individual documents and constant rebuilding of commonly used sets, when a ready-made template can cut the work with a few clicks. In other words, Transaction Templates eliminate the guesswork for which necessary documents are required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Agents, admins and transaction coordinators can also set placeholders for documents that need to be included as the transaction progresses, and, by completing &ldquo;required fields&rdquo; in the transaction details, capture valuable reporting metrics for the team.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div><a href=\"https://www.dotloop.com/teams/?utm_content=native_ad_post_blog_organizing-scalable-teams-conv_teams\" rel=\"noopener\"><img alt=\"Real Estate Team Software\" class=\"lazyloaded ls-is-cached\" src=\"https://35blqf1aden92dok8un11nz1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Real-Estate-Transaction-Reporting-2.png\" style=\"height:582px; width:800px\" /></a></div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h3>Part of a Real Estate Team?</h3>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Dotloop for Teams empowers over 2,000 teams with custom transaction templates, automated compliance, reporting and more. No more sharing login information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a class=\"button button-cta button-solid\" href=\"https://www.dotloop.com/teams/?utm_content=native_ad_post_blog_organizing-scalable-teams-conv_teams\" rel=\"noopener\">Take a Look</a></p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>3. Instant Notifications:</strong>&nbsp; Team Leaders Get Alerted Immediately When Clients Sign Documents</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Dotloop for Teams allows the team leader or transaction coordinators to receive the same real-time email notifications as the agent when a <a href=\"https://www.dotloop.com/documents-esign/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">client signs a document</a>, a message has been received or to alert about a daily task reminder. This feature increases the real estate team&rsquo;s visibility into the status of the transaction and helps to keep all the moving parts of a transaction in forward motion. These settings can be set independently for each team agent within the <a href=\"https://support.dotloop.com/hc/en-us/articles/217389717-Teams-Admin-Notifications#:~:text=As%20a%20dotloop%20team%20admin,%2C%20daily%20task%20reminders%2C%20etc\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">team admin account</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For busy agents, admins and transaction coordinators on the go, push notifications also work on mobile devices, including smartphones and wearables like smart watches. For instance, the <a href=\"https://www.dotloop.com/mobile/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">iOS real estate mobile app</a> has a Settings section that allows the team member to change the push notifications on the device. So an admin or transaction coordinator can receive a notification when a document has been signed and then navigate to the loop involved.</p>\r\n\r\n<div><img alt=\"Get Instant Real Estate Transaction Notifications on your Smart Watch\" class=\"lazyloaded\" src=\"https://35blqf1aden92dok8un11nz1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/dotloop-notifications-on-apple-watch-1.png\" style=\"width:100%\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>4. Loop Tasks:</strong>&nbsp; Gives Agents a Checklist So They Know What to Do Next to Move Deals Forward</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This indispensable feature is like having a personal assistant create and check off an itemized to-do list alerting you and others on the team to complete tasks. Team admins and transaction coordinators can create these lists within the loop or load them from preset templates created by the team. For example, the team might have a set process for Final Closing Procedures or a Listing Checklist, which can be added from the <a href=\"https://support.dotloop.com/hc/en-us/articles/202789723-Loop-Tasks\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">&ldquo;Load task list&rdquo; window</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each task can be personalized with due dates and assigned to someone in the loop followed by optional daily notifications. As each task is completed and the box is checked, the task will &ldquo;gray&rdquo; and move to the bottom of the list.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To easily access tasks, admins and transaction coordinators can move the list to the top of the loop or click on &ldquo;Show Tasks&rdquo; in the &ldquo;More&rdquo; dropdown in Documents.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>5. Compliance Workflows for Teams:</strong>&nbsp; Streamlines the Compliance Review Process for Transaction Coordinators</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Workflows simplify the compliance review process for transaction coordinators by helping to move document folders from stage to stage in the review process and to ensure all necessary documents are completed and make it to the final review by the managing broker on dotloop Business+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Workflows help document management run more smoothly and seamlessly by organizing documents in the order of how the agent needs to work on them. For instance, team admins and transaction coordinators can customize the way a deal goes through the compliance process, from who gets notified to the types of documents needed before submitting for review.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Team workflows complement Transaction Templates as overarching workflows set by transaction type and, because admins and transaction coordinators can tag transactions, they can instantly see what&rsquo;s closing this month, under contract, sold, and the lead source.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Success Managers for Seamless Onboarding</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Every dotloop for Teams customer has access to a <a href=\"https://www.dotloop.com/products/success/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">dedicated Success Manager</a> who can set up the dashboard, help ensure seamless onboarding of new team members and serve as a consultant and business-building resource for the life of the account. Teams receive yearly Executive Business Reviews with their Success Managers to learn dotloop&rsquo;s newest features and to help ensure the team is meeting its goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div style=\"margin-left:0; margin-right:0\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h2>Dotloop PRO: Let Us Do the Heavy Lifting!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Busy teams who don&rsquo;t have time to create interactive documents, build transaction templates or customize workflows can also tap <a href=\"https://www.dotloop.com/products/professional-services/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">dotloop PRO</a> to do the heavy lifting.
